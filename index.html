									<p>Technology is one of the world's greatest resources. Too often, however, many of those who have the will to learn do not get to be exposed to technology to experience the joy of using and cultivating it. Our mission is to change that. Our mission is to provide the tools to access the technology to those who donâ€™t typically have exposure to it. Everyone, no matter their circumstance, should be able to share in the joy and fufillment that technology brings to everyone. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="4u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>We plan to do this by bringing technology such as myyros, circuit boards, drones, go-pros, virtual reality headsets and more to children's hospitals, orphanages, nursing homes, veterans, and homeless shelters. The goal is to spread the love and joy for technology. Our tech-loving staff would spend time and help mentor all who we meet. We will be visiting these places to teach, display technology, and connect with the people one on one.</p>

							<h2>Being a resource for further growth.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Anyone can be a Hacker With Heart. We believe that as long as one has the eagerness to learn and the fascination to grow, they can master anything. In the beginning, our Hackers will simply demo our technology and demonstrate the power of learning how to code. When someone demonstrates an interest in furthering their own learning, we then become a medium through which that becomes possible. We then will work closely with those we visit to provide the online resources and guidance necessary to teach themselves how to code.</p>
